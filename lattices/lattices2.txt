A number of rules for resolving majority cycles in elections have been proposed in the literature.
Recently, Holliday and Pacuit (2021a) axiomatically characterized one such cycle-resolving rule, dubbed
Split Cycle: in each majority cycle, discard the majority preference with the smallest majority margin.
They showed that any given rule satisfying five standard axioms, plus a weakening of Arrow’s Indepen-
dence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) called Coherent IIA, is refined by Split Cycle. That is, Split Cycle
retains as many majority preferences as the given rule and possibly more. In this paper, we go further
and show that Split Cycle is the only rule satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit together with
two additional axioms: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat. Coherent Defeat states
that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is retained, while Positive Involvement in Defeat is
closely related to the well-known axiom of Positive Involvement (see, e.g., Pérez 2001). We characterize
Split Cycle not only as a collective choice rule but also as a social choice correspondence, over both
profiles of linear ballots and profiles of ballots allowing ties.

Hi Yifeng,

Hope things are going well! Eric and I were thinking: should we try to submit the axiomatization and/or the strength of majority preference paper for the Social Choice and Welfare conference by March 28 (https://sscw2020.colmex.mx/index.php/submission/)? They say Zoom participation is okay. They also said the reviewing would be “light” (we’re thinking like ASL-style). Seems like a good opportunity to get some feedback from the social choice community.

Eric and I will work on an abstract for the axiomatization paper now in case you think we can make the deadline :-)

Best,
Wes
